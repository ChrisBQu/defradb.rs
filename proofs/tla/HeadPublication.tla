---- MODULE HeadPublication ----
\* THE STORY.
\* A document's heads live in one head set: one stored value that writers only
\* ever change by merging an operand into it (a blind merge). Replication
\* publishes a block into that set: the block becomes a head, and each parent
\* it names stops being one. A parent that is a head right now is superseded.
\* A parent that is not a head is either a block that was published and has
\* since been superseded, or a block that has not arrived yet; the second is
\* held "ahead", so its own arrival later is swallowed instead of making it a
\* head under its own child.
\*
\* Who acts: transactions, each publishing one block. The same block can be
\* published twice (a replay: gossip delivers it again, or a restart forgets it
\* was merged).
\*
\* What must never happen:
\*   - a block that has a published child reads as a head (a resurrection);
\*   - a published block stays held ahead (a stale name nobody will ever
\*     consume, and a set that no longer says exactly what the DAG says);
\*   - a publication is turned away because of a write that has nothing to do
\*     with the decisions it made.
\*
\* WHAT THE CODE DOES, AND WHERE (the correspondence).
\*   Snapshot(t), the decisions          crates/db/src/block/heads/document.rs `publish`
\*     the block's publication record    its priority index entry `h/p/{doc}/{priority}/{cid}`
\*                                       with the published value; read with `get`, which
\*                                       regolith validates at commit (an Ordinary key)
\*     a parent that is a head           `Set::is_live` on the set the caller read
\*     a parent's record                 `was_published`: the parent's stored block gives its
\*                                       priority, then its priority index entry; not
\*                                       validated, the part read below covers it
\*     the part read                     `get_parts(set key, parts)` naming only the parents
\*                                       held ahead (`head_set::part` per name)
\*   Commit(t), the refusal              regolith's commit check: a `get` is refused by any
\*                                       newer write of its key; a read by parts only by an
\*                                       operand `MergeOperator::touches` says touches a part
\*                                       (crates/storage/src/backends/regolith/merge/head_set.rs
\*                                       `touches`: an operand touches the names it holds)
\*   Commit(t), the writes               `Write::{supersede, supersede_ahead, add}` merged as
\*                                       one operand, and the priority index entry set
\*   Add / Supersede / SupersedeAhead    the per-name table in head_set.rs
\*
\* There is no separate guard key: the record is the priority index entry every
\* publication writes anyway, and the race on a parent goes through the head
\* set's own key.
\*
\* KNOBS. Each RED configuration removes one guard and must fail on the
\* invariant that guard keeps.
\*   Record   = "Durable"     the publication record is read and written. [GREEN]
\*            = "None"        nothing records a publication: a replay of a
\*                            superseded block makes it a head again.
\*                            INV_LiveExact fails.                     [RED]
\*   OwnRead  = "Validated"   the record read is refused at commit by a newer
\*                            publication of the same block.           [GREEN]
\*            = "Unvalidated" two publications of one block both add it, and a
\*                            child that superseded it in between is undone.
\*                            INV_LiveExact fails.                     [RED]
\*   PartRead = "Names"       a parent held ahead is read by its part, which only
\*                            an operand naming that parent refuses.   [GREEN]
\*            = "Off"         no read: the parent arrives and is superseded by a
\*                            second child, then the first child's hold lands
\*                            on it. INV_AheadExact fails.             [RED]
\*            = "WholeSet"    the read is refused by any operand on the set, the
\*                            behaviour of an operator whose `touches` says yes
\*                            to every part. An unrelated block's publication
\*                            turns the reader away. INV_NoUnrelatedAbort
\*                            fails.                                   [RED]

CONSTANTS
  Record,   \* "Durable" | "None": whether a publication leaves a record
  OwnRead,  \* "Validated" | "Unvalidated": whether the record read is checked at commit
  PartRead  \* "Names" | "Off" | "WholeSet": how a parent held ahead is read

\* Every knob takes one of its named values.
ASSUME Record \in {"Durable", "None"}
\* The record read is either checked at commit or not.
ASSUME OwnRead \in {"Validated", "Unvalidated"}
\* The parent read is by names, absent, or of the whole set.
ASSUME PartRead \in {"Names", "Off", "WholeSet"}

\* The blocks: a parent p, two children c and d that both name p (a fork), and
\* an unrelated block e with no parents.
Blocks == {"p", "c", "d", "e"}

\* The parents each block names.
Parents == [b \in Blocks |-> IF b \in {"c", "d"} THEN {"p"} ELSE {}]

\* The transactions: p is published twice (p2 is the replay), every other
\* block once.
Txns == {"p1", "p2", "c", "d", "e"}

\* The block a transaction publishes.
BlockOf(t) == IF t \in {"p1", "p2"} THEN "p" ELSE t

\* The three states a name can have in the head set.
States == {"absent", "ahead", "live"}

\* What an `add` does to a name: absent becomes a head, a name held ahead is
\* consumed (its child already superseded it), a head stays a head.
Add(s) == CASE s = "absent" -> "live"
            [] s = "ahead"  -> "absent"
            [] s = "live"   -> "live"

\* What a `supersede` does: a head stops being one; anything else is unchanged.
Supersede(s) == IF s = "live" THEN "absent" ELSE s

\* What a `supersede_ahead` does: a head stops being one, and a name that was
\* never seen is held ahead.
SupersedeAhead(s) == CASE s = "absent" -> "ahead"
                       [] s = "ahead"  -> "ahead"
                       [] s = "live"   -> "absent"

  recAt,     \* [Blocks -> Nat]: the clock of the newest write of the block's record
  phase,     \* [Txns -> {"idle", "open", "done"}]: where each transaction is
  snap,      \* [Txns -> Nat]: the clock when the transaction took its snapshot
