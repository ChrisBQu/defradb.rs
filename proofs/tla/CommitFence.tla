---- MODULE CommitFence ----
\* The story, in plain words.
\*
\* An explicit transaction lives on one worker, its owner. To commit it, the
\* caller hands the commit to the owner and waits for the answer. The caller
\* can stop waiting at any moment (its future is dropped: the client went
\* away, a timeout fired). Stopping does not undo a commit that already
\* began: that commit still lands, only a little later. The danger: a read or
\* a new transaction that begins after the caller stopped could take its
\* snapshot before the commit lands, and miss it.
\*
\* When does a commit begin? When it is handed over, if no request is running
\* the transaction then. Otherwise it waits for that request and begins when
\* the owner takes it; a caller that stops waiting before that abandons the
\* transaction, and nothing lands. Example: a caller sends "commit" while
\* another request still holds the transaction, then goes away; the owner,
\* done with the request, finds the caller gone and discards the writes. A
\* caller that sends "commit" to an idle transaction and goes away a moment
\* later has not undone anything: the commit lands.
\*
\* The fix is a fence. The database keeps one count, `outstanding`: how many
\* commits are still landing after their caller stopped waiting. Each commit
\* handed to an owner carries a small state word that starts "pending". The
\* caller and the owner race to move it out of "pending" with one
\* compare-and-swap each, so exactly one of them wins:
\*   * the caller, when it stops waiting, first raises the count, then tries
\*     pending -> abandoned; if the owner had finished already (the swap
\*     fails) the caller lowers the count back;
\*   * the owner, once it is finished with the commit (it landed, it failed,
\*     or its request was dropped unrun), tries pending -> done; if the caller
\*     had left (the swap fails) the owner lowers the count.
\* Whoever lowers the count to zero wakes everyone waiting. A reader (a read
\* or a new transaction) looks at the count first: zero means go at once;
\* otherwise it waits for a wake and looks again. A commit whose caller never
\* stops waiting never touches the count: the fast path costs one load.
\*
\* What must never happen:
\*   1. a reader that began after a caller stopped waiting takes a snapshot
\*      that misses that commit, when the commit does land
\*      - INV_ReaderSeesCancelledCommit;
\*   2. the count goes below zero - INV_NeverNegative;
\*   3. a commit whose caller never stopped waiting touches the count
\*      - INV_UncancelledUntouched;
\*   4. once both sides are done with a commit, it still holds part of the
\*      count - INV_SettledExact;
\*   5. the count stays above zero for good (a leaked fence)
\*      - LIVE_NoFenceLeak;
\*   6. a reader waits forever - LIVE_ReaderProceeds;
\*   7. a commit that began when it was handed over is dropped because its
\*      caller went away - INV_BegunEndRuns;
\*   8. a commit whose caller went away before it began lands anyway
\*      - INV_AbandonedEndDiscarded.
\*
\* Every way a commit can end is a path here: it lands, it fails, the owner
\* shuts down (its request dropped unrun, or the commit dropped before it
\* landed), and the caller stops waiting before it handed the commit over,
\* after it handed it over, or after the answer was already on its way.
\*
\* TLC runs whole steps one at a time, as if memory were sequentially
\* consistent. crates/db/src/txn/fence.rs names the Rust memory orderings
\* (Release on each swap and on each lowering, Acquire on each failed swap and
\* on the reader's load) that give every step here the order it has in the
\* model.

CONSTANTS NC, RaiseFirst, OwnerSwaps, ReaderWaits, ResolveFailed, WakeOnUndo,
          RunBegun, DropAbandoned
\* NC is how many commits the model runs. The seven switches are all TRUE in
\* the real design; each RED configuration turns one off.

ASSUME /\ NC \in 1..3
       /\ RaiseFirst \in BOOLEAN
       /\ OwnerSwaps \in BOOLEAN

       /\ ResolveFailed \in BOOLEAN
       /\ WakeOnUndo \in BOOLEAN
       /\ RunBegun \in BOOLEAN
       /\ DropAbandoned \in BOOLEAN
\* A small number of commits, and each switch either on or off.

Commits == 1..NC
\* The commits, named 1, 2, ...

CallerStates == {"idle", "waiting", "raised", "late", "undo", "unotify", "gone", "replied"}
\* Where a caller can be:
\*   idle     - it has not handed its commit over yet;
\*   waiting  - it handed the commit over and waits for the answer;
\*   raised   - it stopped waiting and raised the count; its swap comes next;
\*   late     - (RED only) it swapped first and raises the count next;
\*   undo     - its swap failed (the owner was done first); it lowers next;
\*   unotify  - its lowering reached zero; it wakes the waiters next;
\*   gone     - it stopped waiting, and everything it had to do is done;
\*   replied  - it got its answer and never stopped waiting.

OwnerStates == {"none", "queued", "running", "landed", "failed", "swap", "dec", "notify", "resolved"}
\* Where the owner's side of one commit can be:
\*   none     - nothing was handed to it;
\*   queued   - the commit waits in the owner's mailbox;
\*   running  - the owner is committing it;
\*   landed   - the commit is in: a snapshot taken from now on sees it;
\*   failed   - the commit failed: it will never land;
\*   swap     - the owner is finished with it and tries pending -> done next;
\*   dec      - its swap failed (the caller left); it lowers the count next;
\*   notify   - its lowering reached zero; it wakes the waiters next;
\*   resolved - the owner is done with this commit for good.

ReaderStates == {"before", "fast", "arm", "check", "wait", "done"}
\* Where the one reader can be:
\*   before - it has not begun;
\*   fast   - it has begun and makes its one look at the count;
\*   arm    - the count was not zero: it notes the wake generation next;
\*   check  - it looks at the count again, after noting the generation;
\*   wait   - it sleeps until the generation moves;
\*   done   - it took its snapshot.

VARIABLES callerPc, ownerPc, state, sent, answered, landed, net,
          outstanding, gen, rpc, rgen, seen, snap, begunAtSend, leftFirst
\* callerPc    - where each caller is (CallerStates);
\* ownerPc     - where the owner is with each commit (OwnerStates);
\* state       - each commit's state word: "pending", "abandoned" or "done";
\* sent        - whether each commit was handed to its owner;
\* answered    - whether each caller's answer is ready (a reply, or the
\*               request dropped, which the caller hears as "not found");
\* landed      - whether each commit landed;
\* net         - how much each commit adds to the count right now;
\* outstanding - the count every reader looks at;
\* gen         - the wake generation, moved by each wake;
\* rpc         - where the reader is (ReaderStates);
\* rgen        - the generation the reader noted before its last look;
\* seen        - the commits whose callers had fully stopped waiting when
\*               the reader began: the reader must see each one that lands;
\* snap        - the commits the reader's snapshot holds;
\* begunAtSend - whether each commit began when it was handed over (no
\*               request was running the transaction then);
\* leftFirst   - whether the owner found each commit's caller gone before
\*               the commit began, and so abandoned it.

vars == <<callerPc, ownerPc, state, sent, answered, landed, net,
          outstanding, gen, rpc, rgen, seen, snap, begunAtSend, leftFirst>>

\* At the start nothing was handed over, every state word is pending, the

\* The commits that are in: what a snapshot taken now holds.

\* The owner's wake: the generation moves, so every sleeping reader looks
\* again.

\* ---------------------------------------------------------------- reader

ReaderBegin == /\ rpc = "before"
               /\ seen' = {c \in Commits : sent[c] /\ callerPc[c] = "gone"}
               /\ IF ReaderWaits
                     THEN /\ rpc' = "fast"
                          /\ UNCHANGED snap
                     ELSE /\ rpc' = "done"
                          /\ snap' = Landed
               /\ UNCHANGED <<callerPc, ownerPc, state, sent, answered, landed, net, outstanding, gen, rgen, begunAtSend, leftFirst>>
\* The reader begins, at any moment. It notes which callers had fully
\* stopped waiting by then: their commits are the ones it must see. The RED
\* switch takes the snapshot at once, with no look at the count.

ReaderFast == /\ rpc = "fast"
              /\ IF outstanding = 0
                    THEN /\ rpc' = "done"
                         /\ snap' = Landed
                    ELSE /\ rpc' = "arm"
                         /\ UNCHANGED snap
              /\ UNCHANGED <<callerPc, ownerPc, state, sent, answered, landed, net, outstanding, gen, rgen, seen, begunAtSend, leftFirst>>
\* The one look of the fast path: zero means take the snapshot now.

ReaderArm == /\ rpc = "arm"
             /\ rgen' = gen
             /\ rpc' = "check"
             /\ UNCHANGED <<callerPc, ownerPc, state, sent, answered, landed, net, outstanding, gen, seen, snap, begunAtSend, leftFirst>>
\* Before looking again, the reader notes the wake generation, so a wake
\* that comes after this moment is never lost.

ReaderCheck == /\ rpc = "check"
               /\ IF outstanding = 0
                     THEN /\ rpc' = "done"
                          /\ snap' = Landed
                     ELSE /\ rpc' = "wait"
                          /\ UNCHANGED snap
               /\ UNCHANGED <<callerPc, ownerPc, state, sent, answered, landed, net, outstanding, gen, rgen, seen, begunAtSend, leftFirst>>
\* The second look: zero means go; otherwise sleep.

ReaderWake == /\ rpc = "wait"
              /\ gen # rgen
              /\ rpc' = "arm"
              /\ UNCHANGED <<callerPc, ownerPc, state, sent, answered, landed, net, outstanding, gen, rgen, seen, snap, begunAtSend, leftFirst>>
\* A sleeping reader wakes only when the generation moved past the one it
\* noted, then notes the new one and looks again.

\* ------------------------------------------------------------------ spec

CallerStep(c) == CallerSwap(c) \/ LateRaise(c) \/ Undo(c) \/ UndoWake(c)
\* What a caller that stopped waiting still has to do: these run to the end.

OwnerStep(c) == OwnerStart(c) \/ OwnerLand(c) \/ OwnerFail(c) \/ OwnerReply(c)
                \/ OwnerShutdown(c) \/ OwnerSwap(c) \/ OwnerDec(c) \/ OwnerWake(c)
\* Everything the owner does with one commit, from the mailbox to the end.

ReaderStep == ReaderFast \/ ReaderArm \/ ReaderCheck \/ ReaderWake
\* Everything a begun reader does until its snapshot.

Next == \/ \E c \in Commits : Send(c) \/ DropEarly(c) \/ Drop(c) \/ Receive(c)
        \/ \E c \in Commits : CallerStep(c) \/ OwnerStep(c)
        \/ ReaderBegin \/ ReaderStep
\* Any actor takes any step it can, in any order.

Fairness == /\ \A c \in Commits : WF_vars(CallerStep(c)) /\ WF_vars(OwnerStep(c))
            /\ WF_vars(ReaderStep)
\* A caller that stopped waiting finishes what it started, an owner keeps
\* working through the commits it was handed, and a begun reader keeps going
\* while it can. Handing over, stopping, receiving and beginning are choices:
\* nothing forces them.

Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_vars /\ Fairness
\* The model: start at Init, take steps of Next, with the fairness above.

\* ------------------------------------------------------------ properties

TypeOK == /\ callerPc \in [Commits -> CallerStates]
          /\ ownerPc \in [Commits -> OwnerStates]
          /\ state \in [Commits -> {"pending", "abandoned", "done"}]

          /\ begunAtSend \in [Commits -> BOOLEAN]
          /\ leftFirst \in [Commits -> BOOLEAN]
\* Every variable holds a value of the expected kind (a negative count is
\* allowed here so the RED runs can show it under its own name).

INV_ReaderSeesCancelledCommit == rpc = "done" => \A c \in seen : landed[c] => c \in snap
\* Promise: a reader that began after a caller stopped waiting sees that
\* caller's commit whenever the commit lands.

INV_NeverNegative == outstanding >= 0
\* Promise: the count never goes below zero.

Cancelled(c) == sent[c] /\ callerPc[c] \in {"raised", "late", "undo", "unotify", "gone"}
\* A commit is cancelled when it was handed over and its caller then stopped
\* waiting.

INV_UncancelledUntouched == \A c \in Commits : ~Cancelled(c) => net[c] = 0
\* Promise: a commit whose caller never stopped waiting adds nothing to the
\* count, ever (the fast path stays one load).

Settled(c) == callerPc[c] \in {"gone", "replied"} /\ ownerPc[c] \in {"none", "resolved"}
\* Both sides are done with a commit.

INV_SettledExact == \A c \in Commits : Settled(c) => net[c] = 0
\* Promise: once both sides are done with a commit, it holds no part of the
\* count: every raise was matched by exactly one lowering.

INV_BegunEndRuns == \A c \in Commits : begunAtSend[c] => ~leftFirst[c]
\* Promise: a commit that began when it was handed over is never abandoned
\* because its caller went away; it runs, and lands unless it fails.

INV_AbandonedEndDiscarded == \A c \in Commits : leftFirst[c] => ~landed[c]
\* Promise: a commit whose caller went away before it began never lands: the
\* transaction is abandoned and its writes are discarded.

LIVE_NoFenceLeak == <>[](outstanding = 0)
\* Promise: the count comes back to zero and stays there once every commit
\* is done.

LIVE_ReaderProceeds == (rpc \in {"fast", "arm", "check", "wait"}) ~> (rpc = "done")
\* Promise: a reader that began always gets to take its snapshot.
