# CommitFence.Swap: the caller and the owner settle each fence exactly once

The story, in plain words. A caller hands a commit to the worker that owns
its transaction and waits for the answer. Each such commit carries a small
state word that starts "pending". If the caller stops waiting, it raises the
database's count of commits still landing, then tries to swap the word from
pending to "abandoned". The owner, once it is finished with the commit, tries
to swap the word from pending to "done". A swap only works on a pending word,
so the two race and exactly one wins. The loser lowers the count: a caller
that lost (the owner was done first) takes its own raise back; an owner that
lost (the caller had left) lowers the caller's raise once the commit is done.

What must never happen:
* both swaps win, or both lose (`exactly_one_wins`);
* the caller's one raise is lowered twice, or never (`one_lowering_per_raise`);
* the caller wins and the owner does not lower, which would leak the raise
  (`caller_win_means_owner_lowers`);
* a commit whose caller never stopped waiting lowers anything
  (`uncancelled_owner_wins`).

The temporal story (the raise comes before the caller's swap, a reader looks
at the count, wakes) is the TLA+ model `proofs/tla/CommitFence.tla`; this file
carries the law that model takes on trust about the two swaps.

Rust anchors: `Fence::abandon` and `Fence::finish` (`crates/db/src/txn/fence.rs`),
two `compare_exchange` calls on one `AtomicU8`, modeled here as their
sequential meaning.
