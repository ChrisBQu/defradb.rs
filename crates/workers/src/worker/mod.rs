//! A worker: one thread running a local executor (or, in driven mode, a
//! caller's thread driving one). Tasks are spawned onto it with
//! [`spawn_local`] and run there until they finish: no task stealing, and a
//! waker from any thread puts its task back on this worker's run queue.
//!
//! Each round a worker takes a batch from its inboxes, polls a batch of ready
//! tasks (each under `catch_unwind`, publishing a heartbeat), polls its hook
//! (the regolith `IoQueue`) between tasks, and fires due timers. With nothing
//! to do it spins briefly, then parks until a push, a wake, a timer or its
//! hook needs it. Everything here is touched only by the worker's own thread
//! except [`WorkerShared`], its face to other threads.
