//! Placing a thread: pin it, set its memory policy (after pinning, so local

//! Workers take the plan's seats. Every other class (edge, periodic,
//! compaction, blocking) takes the background CPUs, one node per thread in
//! turn. A class's first fallback is warned about once; the workers' are
//! summed up in the start-up report instead.
