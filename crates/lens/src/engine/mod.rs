//! The lens engine: the one WASM runtime a database runs its lens transforms
//! on, and the store a database gets when no runtime is built in.
//!
//! A database takes its store from [`default_store`]. With the
//! `wasmtime-runtime` feature that store runs on one `LensEngine`: a wasmtime
//! engine, the sandbox its calls run under, the one `Linker` every module
//! links against, and what advances its epoch (a [`TickSource`]). Every store
//! derived from it, a transaction's registrations included, shares all of
//! them: a transaction never builds an engine, a linker or a clock of its
//! own. The ticks stop with the last clone of the engine, and a clock thread
//! that panicked is reported then.
//!
//! A lens module is compiled and linked once, when it is registered, into an
//! `InstancePre`. Each call (the `call` module) instantiates it in a store of
//! its own, made here so the limits a call runs under always match the
//! features the engine was built with, and runs it on a fiber its caller
//! polls: the call streams its documents, yields on every epoch tick, and
//! traps past the sandbox's fuel or ticks for one input document.
//!
//! Without the `wasmtime-runtime` feature there is no engine: the default store
//! is [`UnsupportedTransformStore`], which refuses registration and execution
//! with an error that names the missing feature.
