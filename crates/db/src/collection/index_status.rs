//! Which of a collection's indexes take writes and which answer queries.
//!
//! An index whose build or drop is an action still running, or whose build
//! failed, answers no query; one whose build failed takes no writes either.
//! A reindex a schema change owes the collection covers every index: until it
//! settles, the entries may describe documents at an older version or be half
//! rebuilt, so queries plan scans instead. Writers keep maintaining every
//! index that takes writes throughout.
