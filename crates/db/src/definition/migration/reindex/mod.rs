//! Rebuilding a collection's secondary indexes after a schema change, a page
//! per engine transaction.
//!
//! A schema change owes its collection a reindex ([`owed`]). The rebuild runs
//! as a chain of pages ([`page`]), each holding at most a page of work, so no
//! transaction grows with the collection:
//! - the clear removes every entry of each index that takes writes, a page of
//!   keys at a time, entries in an older key encoding included;
//! - the walk visits the documents in short ID order, migrates each one stored
//!   at an older version through the transforms on its path, persists it, and
//!   indexes it again (`IndexManager::reindex_document`);
//! - the page that walks past the last document gives vector indexes their
//!   chance to train and clears the owed record.
//!
//! Each page commits its cursor with its work ([`progress`]), so a rebuild a
//! failure or a crash stops resumes after the last page that committed, the
//! next time the reindex is settled (after the next schema change, at every
//! open) or asked for. Until the last page commits, the owed record stands and
//! no index of the collection answers queries, which plan scans instead.
//!
//! Writers keep every index that takes writes current for their own documents
//! throughout. A document whose entries the clear removed was committed before
//! the clear's last page, so its short ID is below the walk's fence, taken
//! once that page committed; one created later is its writer's to index.
//!
//! What it costs: while a reindex is owed, a query over the collection scans
//! it, and a vector search over it is refused as during an index backfill. A
//! unique index is enforced against entries the walk has put back so far, so
//! a duplicate a writer slips in during that window meets the walk, which
//! settles it the way a merge does (the deterministic winner) and reports it.
