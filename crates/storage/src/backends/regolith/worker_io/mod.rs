//! The I/O a pool worker does for the stores it reads and writes.
//!
//! Each worker of a [`workers::Pool`] built with [`with_worker_io`] holds one
//! regolith `IoQueue` per database it touches, opened on its own thread the
//! first time a transaction there reaches that database, and polls every one
//! of them between tasks ([`WorkerIo`], the pool's hook). A transaction that
//! starts on such a worker reads in `ReadMode::CacheOnly` on that queue, so a
//! block the cache does not hold suspends the task on its `IoWait` instead of
//! the thread on the device. Native stores placed on a pool commit on its
//! blocking threads, because cache-only commit validation cannot resume
//! after consuming a transaction. The
//! queues live in the worker's thread-local registry ([`registry`]) and only
//! that worker polls them.
//!
//! A caller off the workers of a store's pool (a network task not yet routed
//! to the pool) borrows one worker's queue for that store ([`StoreIo`]): its
//! reads miss into that queue and its commits complete there, so it never
//! reads the device or waits for a sync on its own thread. Each such call is
//! counted (`off_pool_calls`), because it is a request that was not routed.
//! A store with no pool, or whose pool has stopped (a test, a one-shot CLI
//! tool, the last close), reads in `ReadMode::Blocking` and commits
//! synchronously, as a synchronous caller asks for.
//!
//! [`settle`] waits out what a non-blocking call hands back, and [`drive`]
//! runs work whose waits are on a queue of its own from the task that awaits
//! it, for a caller that is not a worker.
