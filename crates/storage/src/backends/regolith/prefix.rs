//! The store's prefix extractor: a prefix seek of one entity's keys reads
//! only the tables that hold that entity.
//!
//! Every table regolith writes keeps a bloom filter of the entity prefixes
//! its keys carry, as `families` cuts them: one document's heads, its
//! markers, its commit priority index and its head publications; one
//! collection's heads and markers, its document values, deletion markers and
//! versions; one index's entries; one ACP object's tuples. A read-only scan
//! of exactly a prefix seeks it as a prefix (`iterator`), and regolith passes
//! over every table whose filter lacks the entity the prefix names. A
//! transaction's scans are read through its cursor, which regolith positions
//! without prefix filters, so they read as before.
