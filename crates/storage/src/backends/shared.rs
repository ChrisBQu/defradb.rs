//! Pieces every store needs that are not the store itself: the durability
//! mode, and the diagnostics a node reports.
//!
//! What used to live here was a second concurrency-control implementation
//! layered over backends that had none: a conflict tracker, a read set, a
//! publication gate, and the version bookkeeping to drive them. regolith
//! validates its own transactions, so all of it is gone, and a
//! transaction's callbacks live in one registry
//! ([`TxnCallbacks`](crate::corekv::TxnCallbacks)). What remains is counters
//! for what actually happened.
